<h2>Now he no longer has much time to live.</h2>
<p>Before his death he gathers in his head all his experiences of the entire time up into one question which he has not yet put to the gatekeeper. He waves to him, since he can no longer lift up his stiffening body.</p>
<p>"What do you want to know now?" asks the doorkeeper; "you are insatiable."</p>
<p>"Everyone strives to reach the Law," says the man, "so how does it happen that for all these many years no one but myself has ever begged for admittance?"</p>
<p>The doorkeeper recognizes that the man has reached his end, and to let his failing senses catch the words, roars in his ear: "No one else could ever be admitted here, since this gate was made only for you. I am now going to shut it."</p>
